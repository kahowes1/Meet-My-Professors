<header>About The Course</header>
<p>This is an online course that Virginia Tech offers for its students. The course explains the geography, political, economic, ect. agenda of each “region” of the world. It helps inform students of why the world developed in different regions based on what they had to work with. This class has weekly quizzes on various form of media from movies, to lecture videos to readings in the textbooks. The online aspect of the class makes it so that you can work at your own pace.

<header>My Opinion</header>
<p>I really liked this class more than I thought I would. Even though I never got to meet my professor his online lectures were still very effective. It is clear that he is a good teacher who knows what he is talking about. I enjoyed that in this class I could work at my own pace and with careful scheduling I was able to finish before thanksgiving break!
