<header>About The Course</header>
<p>Principles of Public Relations introduces students to public relations. The course is a prerequisite for higher-level public relations courses and  is supposed to establish a conceptual foundation for public relations majors.</p>
<header>My Opinion</header>
<p>I don’t recommend anyone taking this course if you are not required to. Most of the content for the tests and quizzes are not discussed in class and I had to teach myself the information. The time allotted for the tests and exams is not sufficient for understanding the question and leads to poor grades.</p>
<header>My Expected Grade</header>
<p>My expected grade is an A</p>
